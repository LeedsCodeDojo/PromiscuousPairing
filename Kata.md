# String Calculator

Write a function or method which takes a calculation as a string and outputs the result.

e.g.

    calculate("1+2*3-4") = 5.
    
Only natural numbers withint the integer range of your platform are allowed.

There is no operator precedence - each step of the calculation is left-associative (e.g. done in order for left to right).

Assume the input has already been verified - you don't have to check for or handle invalid input.

If your language includes functions which do this for you (e.g. eval), you cannot use them.
