# Pairing Rules

Both coders must drive, as equally as possible.

It's up to both parties to agree how to code - you might want to decide up front on things like:
- language
- unit testing
- TDD
- pairing method
- how to spproach the problem

If you're struggling to decide, here are some defaults:
- language: F# ;-)
- unit testing: Yes
- TDD: Yes
- pairing method: Test ping-pong (one write test, other implement then write next test, etc.)
- how to spproach the problem: start with 1+1, add more operators, then more numbers.
